I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI and ML at SRM University, Andhra Pradesh. My interests include systems programming, backend development, Web3, and cloud deployment. I also have experience building end-to-end systems from scratch, having worked with over 50 clients as a freelance developer.

## Internships

**Summer 2025:** Google Summer of Code Contributor with the OpenAFS Foundation, focused on enhancing the Linux kernel module by implementing multi-page folio support to optimize memory handling and improve I/O performance across versions.

**2024–2025:** Research Intern, where I designed a profile-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for enterprise knowledge systems. The work introduced security-aware embeddings and adaptive re-ranking, earning a Gold Medal for its technical innovation.

**2023–2024:** Full Stack Development Intern at Myraa Technologies, where I engineered and deployed a scalable healthcare and insurance platform on AWS. Built core backend services using Tornado, integrated predictive algorithms, and managed data persistence with Neo4J and MySQL.


In my free time, I enjoy talking to new people, building projects, discussing startups and emerging technologies.
