## cUrlBaby  
**A lightweight Postman alternative for your terminal.**  
I built cUrlBaby because my MacBook had limited memory, and Postman was a resource hog. So I created my own CLI-based API testing suite—lightweight, fast, and written entirely in Java.

- Replicates essential Postman features via command line  
- Supports all HTTP methods and JSON formatting  
- Ideal for developers who love minimal tools

- Instantly generates live mock APIs  
- Built-in dashboard to manage routes and responses
